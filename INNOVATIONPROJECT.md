# Innovation Project
This is mainly for people in this FLL group, but others are welcome to read it as well.

# Problem Statement
Music and programming both share the same setback to attracting more people. This is that they are usually hard. The problem with things to ease newbies into
these hobbies though is that once they have eased them into it, there is not much out there for people who haven't just started, but aren't advanced either. In music, FL Studio looks
hard, but Chrome Music Lab is way too incapable. In programming, Python and JavaScript look hard, but Scratch is way too easy.

# Why we chose <i>this</i> over anything else
Music and programming are both interests of [sg631], and all of us like programming. We came up with other ideas that meet the theme,
Entertainent/your hobby, but we voted and decided that this would have an impact, so we should do this.

# How this will <i>solve</i> the problem
