# Innovation Project
This is mainly for people in this FLL group, but others are welcome to read it as well.

## Problem Statement
Music and programming both share the same setback to attracting more people. They are hard. Even the easy programs have a problem though. They are too easy, and do not prepare them for crossing the gap between easy and hard programs. For example, FL Studio looks hard, but Chrome Music Lab is way too incapable. Python and JavaScript look hard, but Scratch is way too easy. Another problem that programming has is that programmers are often unable to find or make music and sound effects for their games and projects. Some music creators might make something that sounds like it should be in a game, but they don't know how to put in a project themselves.

## Why we chose <i>this</i> over anything else
Music and programming are both interests of [sg631], and all of us like programming. We came up with other ideas that meet the theme,
<b>Entertainent/Your Hobby</b>, but we voted and decided that this would have an impact, so we should do this.

## How this will <i>solve</i> the problem
This will be a medium-level editor that is not too advanced, but not too basic either. It will be more advanced than Scratch, but still guide users along. This solves the problem of no middle point by allowing users to enjoy music and programming without quitting because it gets too advanced or limiting themselves to basic software. Having the music and programming editor in one also solves the problems of programmers having no music and music creators having too much music.

#### Why this is on GitHub, instead of Google Docs
This is on GitHub so that we can have everything in one place. Google Docs is great for storing information like this file, but it is easier to store things like the demonstration and images on Github.
