# Innovation Project
This is mainly for people in this FLL group, but others are welcome to read it as well.

## Problem Statement
Music and programming both share the same setback to attracting more people. They are <b>hard</b>. Even the easy tools for coding and music creation have a problem though. They are too easy, and do not prepare users for crossing the gap between easy and hard tools. What this means is that all music and programming tools are <b>too easy or too hard</b>. For example, FL Studio looks hard, but Chrome Music Lab is way too incapable. Python and JavaScript look hard, but Scratch is way too easy. Another problem that programming has is that programmers are often unable to find or make music and sound effects for their games and projects. Some music creators might make something that sounds like it should be in a game, but they don't know how to put in a project themselves. 

## How this will <i>solve</i> the problem
The solution to the problems mentioned above will be an editor that guides users along while still helping transition to harder tools. This solves the main problem by allowing users to enjoy music creation and programming without getting frustrated from it being <b>too easy</b> or <b>too hard</b>. Having the music creation tool and programming editor in one also solves the problems of programmers having <b>no music</b> and music creators having <b>too much music</b>.

## Why we chose <i>this</i> over anything else
Music and programming are both interests of @sg631, and all of us like programming. We came up with other ideas that meet the theme,
<b>Entertainent/Your Hobby</b>, but we voted and decided that this would have an impact, so we should do this.
