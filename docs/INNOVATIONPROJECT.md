## Problem Statement
Music and programming both share the same setback to attracting more people. They are <b>hard</b>. Even the easy tools for coding and music creation have a problem though. They are too easy, and do not prepare users for crossing the gap between easy and hard tools. What this means is that all music and programming tools are <b>too easy or too hard</b>. For example, FL Studio looks hard, but Chrome Music Lab is way too incapable. Python and JavaScript look hard, but Scratch is way too easy. Another problem that specificaly programming has is that programmers are often unable to find or make music and sound effects for their games and projects.

## How this will <i>solve</i> the problem
Our solution is to create an editor that combines the capability to code in a range of programming langauges with the ability to create music for the program that is being made, while having the editor still be intermediate level. For example: If a game programmer is creating a game, he/she can build the game code and music on our platform and test it with the editor, even without being very advanced in either field. The programmer does not have to change to a different program to create the entire game; it can be all in one place.

## Why we chose <i>this</i> over anything else
All of us at Digitech enjoy music and prgramming, which is why we came up with this idea, as it incorporates both in a way that solves two problems at once.
